# Overview
This project is pretty much driven by me trying to get a react webapp up and not need to host my own server because I'm frugal af. In the end, its just a bunch of technology slapped together and it runs like a champ. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app is hosted by github.io, and uses `gh-pages` to transform my react into something that can be hosted on github and then deploy it. The front end is driven by [semantic-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), which I have never used before and may very well never use again. `craco` and `gulp` are used because apparently `create-react-app` doesn't support `LESS` out of the box, and those fix it.
